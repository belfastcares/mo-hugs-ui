## GoReportDevelopersTask

This is my interpretation of the Go Report developers challenge, the following requirements from the brief have been met:


-The ability to display a random movie quote

-The ability to display a list of movie quotes

-The ability to show a single movie quote

The OMDB API has also been utilised to retrieve and display the corresponding movie poster and IMDB movie rating along with the quotes.
The 'Monty Python's Life of Brian' film does not exist in the api database and thus the poster and IMDB data is not returned.

To set up the project simply clone the repo and run the following command within the folder root and finally 
direct your browser to **http://localhost:8000/**

**python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000**
